# MMM-whoshome

**Magic Mirror Module for Displaying Who is Home**

This module tracks who is at home by detecting the presence of personal cellular phones on the local network. It can also be used with laptops, cars (e.g., Teslas), or any other Wi-Fi-enabled devices.

**Note:** Most phones use randomized MAC addresses. For accurate tracking, ensure your phone uses its real MAC address on your home network.

It looks like this: (Not at home persons are in greyscale)

## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have `nmap` installed on your Linux (Raspberry Pi) server.

### Install `nmap`

```bash
sudo apt -y install nmap
```

## Installation

1. Navigate to the MagicMirror modules directory:

    ```bash
    cd MagicMirror/modules
    ```

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yedidiaklein/MMM-whoshome
    ```

## Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `config.js` file:

```javascript
{
    module: "MMM-whoshome",
    position: "top_right",
    config: {
        "TRACK": {
            "John": {
                "mac": "12:34:56:78:90:12",
                "image": "config/people/John.png"
            },
            "Ploni": {
                "mac": "90:80:70:60:50:40",
                "image": "config/people/ploni.jpg"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Image Configuration

You can specify the path to user images either as URLs or as local files within the `config/people` directory. (Create people under config directory, and copy to there your images.)

## Advanced Configuration

- **Network Identification:** The script `mapmacs.sh` may not work perfectly with non-standard networks (i.e., not a /24 subnet). Adjust the `network` line manually if necessary.
- **Presence Detection:** The script `macping.sh` assumes a person is no longer present if he havenâ€™t been detected for 5 minutes. You can adjust this duration, as phones might go to sleep and temporarily disappear even if the person is at home.

## Style and UI
- You can change colors, font size, font family, padding, borders and other UI effects by copying the content of `whoshome.css` to `css/custom.css` and overriding there whatever you want.

## Suggestions

Any suggestions for improvements or feedback are welcome!
